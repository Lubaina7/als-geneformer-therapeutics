TASK 4: THERAPEUTIC TARGET PRIORITIZATION
======================================================================

Methodology:
  Optimization approach:
    - Test multiple perturbation factors per gene
    - Knockdown factors: [0.2, 0.5]
    - Knockup factors: [2.0, 3.0]
    - Select optimal factor based on composite score

  Composite score weights:
    - Rescue potential (40%): Movement toward healthy state
    - Coverage (30%): % cells that improve
    - Effect size (15%): Sufficient strength (3-8 optimal)
    - Preservation (15%): Maintains cell identity

Results:
  Genes evaluated: 3
  Disease-rescuing: 2
  Mean coverage: 24.0%
  Mean rescue score: -0.001

Optimal factor distribution:
  0.5x: 3 genes

TOP 10 THERAPEUTIC TARGETS
======================================================================

 1. DMD (knock_down @ 0.5x)
    Composite: 0.213
    Rescue: 0.000 | Coverage: 28.0%
    Effect: 0.02 | Preservation: 0.854
    Tested: 4 factors
    Rationale: Upregulation by 0.5x: minimal rescue effect, limited coverage (28%), excellent cell identity preservation.

 2. MAP1B (knock_down @ 0.5x)
    Composite: 0.207
    Rescue: -0.000 | Coverage: 26.0%
    Effect: 0.03 | Preservation: 0.854
    Tested: 4 factors
    Rationale: Upregulation by 0.5x: minimal rescue effect, limited coverage (26%), excellent cell identity preservation.

 3. KHDRBS2 (knock_down @ 0.5x)
    Composite: 0.190
    Rescue: -0.003 | Coverage: 18.0%
    Effect: 0.01 | Preservation: 0.900
    Tested: 4 factors
    Rationale: Upregulation by 0.5x: minimal rescue effect, limited coverage (18%), excellent cell identity preservation.


Recommendations:
  1. Validate top candidates in experimental models
  2. Test optimal factors in dose-response studies
  3. Assess combination therapies with multiple targets
  4. Investigate mechanisms of top rescue candidates
  5. Monitor for off-target effects at optimal factors
